To obtain an optimal parameter set for all three models, we built a Julia \cite{Bezanson2017} program which used the Ipopt \cite{Wachter2006} non-linear solver as a part of the JuMP \cite{Dunning2017} mathematical optimisation package.

All values which could be identified empirically were configured as fixed values in the optimisation, and those that could be bounded by empirical data had said bounds applied.
[perhaps outline the choice of fixed values here?]
That leaves the following parameters and bounds for the optimisation of the BEM model:

\begin{align*}
    0.0 \leq &g \leq 3.2 \quad &\text{Population growth rate}\\
    1000.0 \leq &\kappa \leq 2148.0 \quad &\text{Cost of processing}\\
    0.0 \leq &E(t) \leq 1.0 \quad &\text{Fishing effort}\\
    K-(0.3K) \leq &S(t) \leq K+(0.3K) \quad&\text{Squid population}\\
    &p_f  \quad &\text{Price for fishers}\\
    &C(t)  \geq 0.0 \quad &\text{Squid catch}\\
    &p_m \geq 0.0 \quad &\text{Export/Market price}.
\end{align*}


Four constraints satisfy the BEM model, the top three being non-linear

\begin{align}
    S(t+1) &= S(t)\left[g S(t)\left(1-\frac{S(t)}{K}\right)-C(t)\right]\\
    p_m(t) &= \gamma_m C(t)^{-\beta}\\
    C(t) &= qE(t)S(t)\\
    p_f(t) &= p_m(t)-\kappa
\end{align}

The non-linear objective function is a sum of least squares match to the empirical catch $C$ and price for fishers $p_f$ found in [??].

Optimal values for the two unkown variables in the BEM model were found to be $g = 0.5935$ and $\kappa = 2148.0$.
This hard constraint on the cost of processing is one reason why the price for fishers is not captured correctly in the BEM model (see Figure ??).
Parameters such as Effort, Catch etc are shown in Figure ?? of the main text.

To obtain results for the EDM and MLM models, all optimal parameters of the BEM model are used.
This allows us to directly compare the improvements mady by including the additional social interactions discussed in the main text.
